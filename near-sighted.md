## Believers experiencing life with Temporal mindset… 

1. Are we really believers? What do we really believe in?
1. View problems as negative, missing opportunities 
1. Living as if this is "it", this is reality
1. Death is bad, even for believers
1. People are obstacles
1. We elevate ourselves while standing on others
    
### Blind Leaders

1. The blind leading the blind
   
### Interpreting Bible through temporal lense

1. When we hear, "God is with us," we hear that God will help us In this life. Disappointed when God doesn't act as expected.
1. We read about the fruit of the spirit and we think we see it as a list of things to do instead of evidence of what God is doing.
1. We read about sin and we see it as a list of things not to do as opposed to evidence we still have parts of our heart that are untransformed. And if we are aware that we have parts of our heart that are untransformed, we think we need to work towards transforming those parts instead of trusting God to handle it while we focus on loving more.
1. We read the old testament as a set of stories that don't have connection with today's reality. We miss the evidence of God preparing his creation for eternity the whole time.

### Temporal expectations of a life meant for eternity

1. So much emphasis on gaining salvation as if it's a box to check off
1. We amass wealth and grab for everything as if there's nothing more to life.

### God's Bar

#### Nominal/cultural Christianity is not gods plan (living in sin? just as bad as blatant sin?)
1. Is this what “Lukewarm” means?
1. Cold is better… at least atheism is honest (albeit still damnable)
1. Actions, demonstrate something closer to atheism
1. Words sound “godly” (well, close anyways)

#### But God wants even us nominal, unbelieving christians to find him
1. even with our crap, God gives us 1000’s of Chances to encounter Him
