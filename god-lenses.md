### Father, relentless teacher

### God is love, desires to multiply love
1. Love has a lot to do with why God created us in the first place
1. Creating something with free will and the risk of rejection is the only way to have real love

### God is just
1. Our rebellion is no surprise either, God is prepared to lose us if that’s what we choose (back to free will, no love without free will, justice and love cannot exist without the other)

### God is Eternal
1. Sees our emergencies like a father sees a 2-yr-old with a scraped knee

### Never caught off-guard, Knows all because he Created it all, 

### knows how we work
1. Knows what we need to fulfill His purpose for us

### Creator, owner of everything
1. Host, president, supreme leader
1. Probably sees our “laying claim to his possessions” as cute like a father watching a child ignorantly laying claim to a chair as “his”.

### Like a good father, God is a Relentless Teacher
1. Every moment is teachable
1. God is intentional, never a pointless moment or action for God
1. “Be still and know that I am God” - Jeff in hospital, ready to freak out
1. “Works together for the good” – Good as in preparing us for eternity

### Has a purpose for us on this earth
1. Use the free will he gave us to 1) choose to love Him and 2) help others to do the same. Meanwhile,  He is continually saving and sanctifying his creation

### God's eternal perspective on our temporal emergencies
1. Like a father dealing with know-it-all children        
1. Like an Airbnb host with bad guests
