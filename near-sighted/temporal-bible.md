 1. Interpreting Bible through temporal lense
        1. When we hear, "God is with us," we hear that God will help us In this life. Disappointed when God doesn't act as expected.
        1. We read about the fruit of the spirit and we think we see it as a list of things to do instead of evidence of what God is doing.
        1. We read about sin and we see it as a list of things not to do as opposed to evidence we still have parts of our heart that are untransformed. And if we are aware that we have parts of our heart that are untransformed, we think we need to work towards transforming those parts instead of trusting God to handle it while we focus on loving more.
        1. We read the old testament as a set of stories that don't have connection with today's reality. We miss the evidence of God preparing his creation for eternity the whole time.
