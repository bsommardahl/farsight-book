## Seeking God's eternal perspective.

DISCLAIMER: Lots of ideas here. We've tried to organize the thoughts into a continuum that builds a case for seeking more intentionally the eternal perspective of God. It's a work in progress that will likely change at least 1000 times before the project is complete.

#### Outline
1. On Fire
    1. once upon a time
        1. Life-changing experiences
            1. Youth group devos
            1. Camp
            1. Conferences
        1. Heaven on earth experiences
        1. Conversion experiences
        1. Spiritual high
    1. But now…
        1. Calm Fire
1. Short-Sighted: we've got vision problems
    1. Believers experiencing life with Temporal mindset… 
        1. really believers? What do we really believe in?
        1. View problems as negative, missing opportunities 
        1. Living as if this is "it", this is reality
        1. Death is bad, even for believers
        1. People are obstacles
        1. We elevate ourselves while standing on others
    1. Interpreting Bible through temporal lense
        1. When we hear, "God is with us," we hear that God will help us In this life. Disappointed when God doesn't act as expected.
        1. We read about the fruit of the spirit and we think we see it as a list of things to do instead of evidence of what God is doing.
        1. We read about sin and we see it as a list of things not to do as opposed to evidence we still have parts of our heart that are untransformed. And if we are aware that we have parts of our heart that are untransformed, we think we need to work towards transforming those parts instead of trusting God to handle it while we focus on loving more.
        1. We read the old testament as a set of stories that don't have connection with today's reality. We miss the evidence of God preparing his creation for eternity the whole time.
    1. Projecting temporal image on our eternal God
        1. We think of God changing over time, as if God exists in time like we do.
    1. Temporal expectations of a life meant for eternity
        1. So much emphasis on gaining salvation as if it's a box to check off
        1. We amass wealth and grab for everything as if there's nothing more to life.
    1. Nominal/cultural Christianity is not gods plan (living in sin? just as bad as blatant sin?)
        1. Is this what “Lukewarm” means?
        1. Cold is better… at least atheism is honest (albeit still damnable)
        1. Actions, demonstrate something closer to atheism
        1. Words sound “godly” (well, close anyways)
    1. But God wants even us nominal, unbelieving christians to find him
        1. even with our crap, God gives us 1000’s of Chances to encounter Him
1. Human Lenses: Things that affect how we see/perceive things
    1. Purpose, our search for meaning
    1. Temporal nature (this is all we know)
    1. Self preservation, survival
    1. Parent instincts, protector
    1. Privilege (it has always worked out, all problems get magically solved in my world)
    1. Knowledge, maturity
    1. History (problems, losses, traumas)
    1. Culture
    1. Entitlement, rights 
    1. Upbringing 
    1. Desires
    1. Rackets (lies we tell ourselves)
    1. Pride
    1. Childish
1. God's Lenses (his nature): 
    1. Father, relentless teacher
    1. God is love, desires to multiply love
        1. Love has a lot to do with why God created us in the first place
        1. Creating something with free will and the risk of rejection is the only way to have real love
    1. God is just
        1. Our rebellion is no surprise either, God is prepared to lose us if that’s what we choose (back to free will, no love without free will, justice and love cannot exist without the other)
    1. God is Eternal
        1. Sees our emergencies like a father sees a 2-yr-old with a scraped knee
    1. Never caught off-guard, Knows all because he Created it all, 
        1. knows how we work
        1. Knows what we need to fulfill His purpose for us
    1. Creator, owner of everything
        1. Host, president, supreme leader
        1. Probably sees our “laying claim to his possessions” as cute like a father watching a child ignorantly laying claim to a chair as “his”.
    1. Like a good father, God is a Relentless Teacher
        1. Every moment is teachable
        1. God is intentional, never a pointless moment or action for God
        1. “Be still and know that I am God” - Jeff in hospital, ready to freak out
        1. “Works together for the good” – Good as in preparing us for eternity
    1. Has a purpose for us on this earth
        1. Use the free will he gave us to 1) choose to love Him and 2) help others to do the same. Meanwhile,  He is continually saving and sanctifying his creation
    1. God's eternal perspective on our temporal emergencies
        1. Like a father dealing with know-it-all children        
        1. Like an Airbnb host with bad guests
1. A Glimpse of Heaven: Salvation
1. Vision Renewal: the HS transforms our perspective (aka sanctification)
    1. God’s effort, not our own
        1. Not an opportunity to relax, we must stay available to God’s work
        1. The HS transforms us
    1. We begin to see things more clearly
        1. The “actual” reality of things, not our immature, world-inspired reality
        1. Salvation see as only a beginning
        1. Realize we are eternal (always have been)
        1. God's version of "Good" is worth blindly trusting 
        1. His plan is better, every time
        1. Every “bad experience” is actually a good experience
        1. Growth is preparation for eternity, “bring it on!"
        1. Temporal, earthly ending (death) is a pass to the real life intended for us
    1. As our perspective is replaced by His, we begin to 
        1. trust Him more
            1. Define “trust”
        1. love others more
            1. Define “love”
            1. See the lost with compassion
        1. seek the Kingdom of God (it was always there) more consistently
        1. bear the fruit of the Spirit (others will be able to see it)
        1. see sin as a waste of time/energy
        1. Show the fruit of the spirit (not some WE produce)
1. I can see! What now?
    1. Become available to the Holy Spirit
    1. Let the HS make you even more available
    1. Join God in what He is doing
        1. Through the church
        1. Finding the lost, teaching them about Him
    1. Celebrate every new view
    1. Measure by the fruit of the spirit
