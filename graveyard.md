“Farsight” 
Audience: Professing Christians, those who desire to deepen their relationship with God, feel stuck in their growth, don't know what to do or where to look

Punishment, discipline… we spend a lot of time trying to avoid it, but isn't that God teaching us. Are we like teenagers constantly trying to get out of punishment and missing valuable lessons in the process?

Eph 3:14-19 full comprehension of gods love… perspective is born out of love because God is love. Made complete, know love that surpasses understanding, not through a glass dimmly but clearly 

"I don't need help from god. I have this life figured out." – the problem is that this person doesn't actually believe or know what God says… this life is not not the point..

Ps 139:23-24 - lead me in everlasting ways. this where God wants us.


Matt 12:34 - Out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks… is that a signal to control the tongue or a signal of a way to measure the heart. 

When we pray for healing, but also ask to know gods plan, is it to be in awe or because we don't really trust and we want to inspect the plans. Ema does that to me with my plans… wants to know what is for dinner, not because he is curious but so that he has a chance to argue and change the plan. That's why I don't tell him… he just needs to trust.

Fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom proverbs

Wisdom= seeing thing with God's perspective.
Fear= understanding my place… child.before a father.

John the Baptist: less of me and more of God. This is a great summary of what God wants for us in this life.

We are called to be different…. But why? Different just to be different? We just stop there… Were called to avoid sin? Why? Just because God doesn't like it? Just because sin leads to hell? We often stop there… I think the "why" is SO important, and SO logical! Without the why, are we even truly convinced?? God has us here to fall in love with him, help others to do the same, and prepare for eternity. Anything outside of that is a complete and utter waste of time.

Refiners fire, God has us here to refine us and purify us. Like the bride that Jesus is preparing and presenting to himself. Eph 5

Sin= waste of time, "fruitless works of darkness" Ephesians 5:1-14

We're offended when we are told about sin. It's because we don't see our life for what it truly is. We are asleep. 

Punishments always have a purpose. Maybe to correct behavior and give a chance to change. Maybe to remove a harmful person from everyone else's lives (grace to everyone else). God causing earthly death is not a ticket to hell necessarily. It might just be grace to everyone else or stopping one from going too far.

God of OT, God of NT… same God showing same mercy to a human race at very different points of development. Like parents disciplining kids at different ages or who have passed certain steps or with certain understandings (Jesus brought a new understanding).

Jesus talks about cutting off an arm or taking out an eye. Extreme? From an earthly perspective yes, from an eternal perspective, no.

Corey: never an excuse to sin. "But what if I'm starving to death. Can't I steal?" Nope, better to die in hunger and enter the eternal banquet.

Christian atheism is sneaky!
Blind obedience for obedience sake
Some are just good at conformity, they find security in obedience because it's easier to obey rules blindly than it is to reason and struggle through belief and surrender
Soldiers who blindly obey poorly informed or wrong orders are at fault. Could we also be just as culpable for blindly obeying God?
On the other hand, blessed is he who has believed but has not seen… So…..
Obedience for the sake of onlookers
Who are we trying to please? God? If so, then our obedience should happen even when we have no audience.
Obedience because it's good fot my worldly or physical comfort
Prosperity…
Obedience because it seems better than our previous bad outcomes
Maybe this is a good starting point but it's still selfish. It's got to convert to something deeper… not about us.



Eternity
In god's presence forever
Todd said he wasn't excited about worshipping God for eternity because he didn't like singing.
"I want a gold one that's silver lined! I've got a mansion just over the hilltop."
Will we be disappointed if we find that eternity is not what we expected.

Intro Chapter(s)

Story: shooter in church, talk them out of it or tell them to listen to the HS after they do it


Outline:
Concept: God wants to give us his perspective
What is heaven?
What is wisdom?
What is sanctification?
What is the kingdom of god?
Both present and future? http://hermeneutics.kulikovskyonline.net/hermeneutics/sermmt.pdf
God has always wanted to bring us into his presence. That is heaven in a nutshell: being eternally and fully in the presence of god. He created us to fall in love with him by choice and join him eternally in his presence. 
Our time on earth is meant to purify us (refiners fire) and prepare us for eternity. That preparation is the process of sanctification (renewing of the mind). 
The kingdom of god the reign, authority, sovereignty of God… it exists whether or not we want it to or recognize it. We cannot bring it into existence or manifest it because it already exists. Theologians think of it as present and future because of their perspective. If you think of something existing only when you can see or feel it, then The kingdom is maybe now or maybe not… or maybe it only exists over there, but not here. But the reality is it’s everywhere and has been for all time. 
“Your kingdom come” refers to our ability to see it. This is in the same sense as “a thought came to me.” We can advance the kingdom of God by helping more people see it and join it. 
The subjects of the kingdom of god are a worldwide community made up of people who have surrendered to Gods sovereignty… the church. The church grows as the numbers of subjects, but the kingdom of God is still the same size since Gods sovereignty is complete with or without subjects… if not us, then the rocks.


Our purpose on this earth

Story to hook reader
What happens when people don’t think like God
Comparisons
Living well vs preparing for eternity
Being spiritual vs discovering/embracing spiritual nature that's already there
Persecution is avoidable vs persecution is desired (because it transforms)
Making God King vs realizing God was always my king and I was just blind
Sculpting David,making the stone look like David vs taking away that which was not David 
Behaving well vs surrendering to God
Studying for knowledge (or worse, superiority) vs studying for approval by God
Wanting heaven for the mansion vs wanting heaven for the presence of God
Will you be disappointed?
What if there was no mansion or reward? Would gods presence be enough for you?
Loving others because it's expected vs loving others because we see them how God the Father sees them
Serving in the church because it's expected by other humans vs serving because it's s chance to participate in helping others fall in love with God
Pray for healing vs pray for peace
Following Jesus for the fanfare or what I can receive on earth or following him because he's the guide to eternity
Want the HS for gifts or for transformation
Giving for recognition or becajde there is need (my need to release, their need to feel love)
Abstain from sin because I'll be punished or will lose something vs abstain from sin because its a complete waste of time as I am being prepared for eternity
Repent from sin because I don't want to lose my spot in heaven vs repent because I crave transformation and don't want to slow down the HS
Enraged by public sin of non-believers vs thankful that they have revealed their lostness like a flag and that someone/I might take the risk to share Christ with them
Hearing another boring sermon because I have to vs because I believe God can renew my mind even through a poor public speaker or boring sermon 
Fear judgement because it will reveal my secret sins vs accept judgement because it leads to purity and love and being in His presence 
Acting righteous for human approval vs being righteous because that's what God is making you




The Problem
God’s path: Sanctification
God’s purpose for us on this earth: prepare us for eternity (sanctify us)
Sanctification is the process of adopting God’s eternal perspective
The HS gives us this perspective. Not something we can do ourselves, but we can slow or prevent the process. 
Over time, we should think more like God and react in similar ways (being godly is thinking and being like God)
Our sanctification will have evidence
Fall more in love with God
Display the fruit of the Spirit
Help others do the same
Our short-sightedness has evidence
Death feels final, like a loss
Others get in our way (negative)
Public Sinners are a big problem (better hidden)
Freedom is sacred
Our path: Childish Rebellion
If we are not thinking more like God after years as a Christian, it can only mean we are slowing or preventing God from changing us
We have “gunk” that’s clogging our system
Temporal perspective prevents us
Like the “rich young ruler” 
Gunk like
Materialism
Life-ism
Treating death as a loss
Comfort
Entertainment
Anxiety, fear
Our problems are the “end of the world”
We view others as problems
Politics is important
Stories
Rob Hodges, Felon
Stephen Curtis Chapman, loss of child
John Mark Hicks, Loss of wife
David Young, stage 4 cancer
Judah, middle school
Jacob, atheist
Me, healed from cancer
Mike Lee, moral failure
Corey T, suicide attempts
Shane Claiborne, life before conversion 
Tony Mac, artist, loss of truit 
Randy Harris, single
Job, loss of everything
Paul, converted Christian killer
Jerome Williams, ministry
James Dobson, loss of focus on the family 
Jeff Mac, health struggles, loss of voice, struggling ministry
The Solution

What is God's Perspective?
Eternal 
Limitless yet self-limiting
Creator (understands his creation)
Loving (parent)
Has us on earth for a clear purpose
Sees sin of unbelievers as evidence that they need to know Him
Sees believers' rebellion as a waste of our precious, short time, and probably worse than the sin of unbelievers… we should know better
Knows only he can reform our hearts to solve our sin problems
Patient, Empathetic, understanding of our ignorant state 
Sees our lives as speck in time
Sees worldly tragedy as opportunity to teach his children
Expects to solve our problems, but in his way and timing (including in eternity)
Sees our earthly deaths as a transition that starts the majority of our existence
Sees "unlovable people" as treasures
Sees reality clearly
Seize our time on Earth as a chance to realize our purpose that he has given us.

Compared to our Perspective?
Carnal, Temporal, 
Limited, yet we seek to control
Created, yet we feel so wise and knowledgeable 
Understanding love only in the temporal, worldly context with glimpses of eternal love when we see sacrifice and unconditional parental love
Believe we get to decide our purpose
Unbelievers are offensive to us, if we are unbelievers our sin isn't misbehavior…. It's freedom and living in real integrity 
Believers Pursue sin for fear of missing out, not experiencing everything this life has to offer would be a waste of a perfectly good life
As believers, our misbehavior is worse than that of unbelievers


Try to manage sin problems on our own because we're sure we can handle it 
Ignorant of the reality of eternity
Experience life as a long time
Thinks worldly tragedy is unfair and we question god's goodness
Are upset with God when he doesn't solve our problems now, in this life
Sees death of self, family, friends, anyone as final and something to avoid at all costs
Sees "unlovable people" as trash to be discarded
Sees reality as if through a blurry window ("through a Glass, dimly")
We see our time on Earth as more chance to realize our own goals and ambitions



Sanctification can be described as the process of adopting God's eternal perspective. The kingdom of God can be described as the adoption of Gods eternal perspective.
We are temporal, and it's what we know, but we can empathize with God's perspective and consider how He sees things, and choose to agree with God and try to see things that was too
We can recognize how limited we are and learn to depend on him more
We can remember that we are the created, and that our creator God knows exactly how we work and what we need.
We can practice sacrificing for people who are not our family
We can realize the clear purpose God has for us and consider everything else a potential distraction. God has us on this earth to prepare us for eternity. He wants us to choose to love Him and help others do the same. 
We can regard sin as a true short-sighted, waste of time
We can invite God to form our hearts and stay out of his way as he works on our sin
We can consider the reality and magnitude of eternity and remember that this life is not our goal, bot only a short step towards The true goal, eternity in god's presence 
We can keep the brevity of this life in mind and stay faithful
We can attempt to see how God might use suffering to teach us, but when it's too hard to see the lesson, we can choose to trust Him regardless of if we understand or not. We can remember that God's goodness is not determined by our understanding 
We can trust God and his timing, keeping in mind that this life is short and the fix might come after this life (or might even come WITH the end of this life)
We can consider the eternal goal of this life and lament earthly death only when we know it is followed by eternal spiritual death, but we should allow that lesson to motivate us to commit ourselves even more to the purpose God has for us and help others to choose to love him as well.
We can see unlovable people as precious children who may have lost their way and need a hand to come back to the light. We can also realize that God can even use those unlovable people to form us spiritually and cause us to love God even more. 
We can realize our natural short-sightedness and blurry vision when regarding situations around us, and commit to thinking about and choosing to see things how God sees them.


What is the Kingdom of God?
The kingdom is gods eternal perspective in our minds and hearts. 
Heaven is simply being in the presence of God with his perspective fully in our minds.
God has us on earth to prepare us for eternity and begin the transformative process of renewing our minds, building/integrating the kingdom into us.
Now we see things like through a blurry glass, but when we are in eternity in gods presence, we will see clearly






What's gods perspective on gender reassignment?
Suicide is increased for people who do this. They find out later, after all this work, the itch they were trying to scratch was the wrong one.
God wants us to fall in love with him, regardless of whatever is going on in their mind or body. And then hang on and stay faithful until they meet eternity.









System of thinking:
God is love, therefore love (and its increase) is the point of everything he has ever done.
God could have created us as beings without a choice, but real love comes from a choice to love. Choiceless love isn’t really love at all. God wants to multiply love, and creating beings who could potentially hate Him was worth the “risk”.
God’s perspective is eternal, he sees things very differently than we do.
We see only what we have already seen, unless something happens to open that up. 
He sees us like a parent sees children.
He loves us through our drama and urgency, knowing how insignificant it really is, but also trying to use it to renew our minds.
God created us to choose to love him despite our own self-centered nature.
God’s purpose for this life is to teach us to adopt His perspective and prepare us for eternity, not for us to remain in our self-centered, temporal ways of thinking and doing.
We are like kids who desperately want to be independent and think they have it all under control and together. — God is like a loving parent who delights in empathizing with his children, and is constantly trying new ways to convince them of his perspective and hoping they will somehow grow.
Every bad thing that happens to us feels like the “end of the world”, but it’s like a skinned knee to God. — Even the most horrible trauma thinkable on this earth would be insignificant from an eternal perspective, as long as the trauma led to salvation and sanctification.
The only truly lamentable human tragedy are experiences that send people down a road of forever hating or rejecting God.
God wants us to learn to fully depend on him in this life because it’s what we will do naturally in eternity.
When we move from this life to eternity, we will share his perspective which is why heaven is heaven…
Just being in the presence of God is enough - Fully dependent on God
No tears, pain, sorrow… it’s not necessary anymore
No regrets or traumas because this life’s experiences were all part of what prepared us for eternity
No need for family or friends because God is enough
Sanctification is the process of adopting God’s eternal perspective
Obedience is more about forming us spiritually and changing our perspective than it is actually going through motions of behaving correctly.
This is why legalistic obedience misses the mark. 
Sin is our childish, myopic way of wasting our own time during this short life, distracting ourselves from God’s mission for us and getting in His way as he is trying daily to work on our hearts.

Time 
Parable of talents

Matthew 25:14-30

[the kingdom of God]

14 “For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants[a] and entrusted to them his property. 15 To one he gave five talents,[b] to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. 16 He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. 17 So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. 18 But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. 

19 Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. 20 And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, I have made five talents more.’ 21 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant.[c] You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 22 And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; here, I have made two talents more.’ 23 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’

24 He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, 25 so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.’ 

26 But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed? 27 Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. 28 So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. 

29 For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. 30 And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’



1 Cor 11:17-34

17 In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. 18 In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. 19 No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God’s approval. 20 So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat, 21 for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk. 22 Don’t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? Certainly not in this matter!

17 Paul is not happy, Paul’s investment
18 Divisions (disagreements vs divisions)
19 the right differences, shows growth
20-21 should be the LS, but it’s YOUR supper (about you)
Some eating first, drinking all the wine
Some left hungry
Selfishness, not love, not about Jesus
22 despise (damaging) the church=humiliating the poor
How should we treat others? People who have less?
This is not just about the LS. We are called to put others first in all!
If we don’t, we are damaging the church

23 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, 24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.” 25 In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.” 26 For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.

23 Paul instructed by Jesus 
24- reminding the point
26 proclaim Jesus sacrifice, represent Jesus (be the church)

27 So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. 28 Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup. 29 For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves. 

27 unworthy manner? (Re 20-21) - baptism or selfishness?
The LS is about Jesus, but when we make it about ourselves, we take his place
Sinning against Jesus, body and blood
Think, we take the place of God is so much
Decisions, motives, disagreements, purchases, time
God allows us time to grow, amidst mistakes
But things supposedly directed at Him must actually be His, no one else
Ananias and Safaira, gave to church but made it about themselves (show)
28 examine yourselves, is this for me or for Jesus?
29 LS for any other than Jesus=Judgement, showing your guilt

30 That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. 31 But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves, we would not come under such judgment. 32 Nevertheless, when we are judged in this way by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world.

30 weak, sick, asleep - spiritually…
Discernment, see what God sees, between right and wrong, honest
Acting without discernment, ignoring God
It won’t work for long
31 avoid guilt/judgement by being honest about who you are and allowing god to transform you
32 grace: god is willing to discipline us and grow us

33 So then, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, you should all eat together. 34 Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment.

33 eat together (simultaneously?) - all with the same focus/reason (Jesus)
34 if you’re coming to serve yourself, do it elsewhere
When the focus is supposed to be on God, leave it there, don’t take it for yourself

What can we learn?
God wants the spotlight
God does not share the focus
The LS is special and cannot be about us
God values need, not selfishness
God wants to fulfill needs, not selfish desires
God gives us time, but expects us to grow up

Is it time for you to grow up? Maybe you need help taking the first step?



What is the evidence that we don't possess the perspective of God:
We sue our brothers and sisters in worldly court
We let the effects of high taxes or poor govt policies on our lives get us fired up
We amass wealth to increase our own station or level of comfort
We spend more time seeking entertainment than godly enlightenment
We value our social success more than our reputation as a committed, on fire follower of Jesus.
We seek the gifts of the spirit more than the fruits
We ask "what is the minimum I need to do to please God?"
We ignore the push of the hs to take risks for his sake because it might affect our comfort, station or social success
We avoid helping or serving too much because it could threaten our future
We work only for a paycheck instead of to glorify God.
We pretend to be ignorant of others' suffering to avoid having to get dirty or be inconvenienced.
We look about the same, spiritually speaking, today that we got baptisms or first made a commitment to follow Jesus
We have no patience for people who behave in worldly ways
We raise our children to be socially successful, good citizens, good church members, but not to love God and be ready to obey the HS even when it's hard
We demand our rights as USA citizens even when it affects others negatively
We focus more on correcting our own behavior for sins that are visible to others than seeking accountability for sins that are easily hidden
We sell property and make other christians think we are giving all the money to the poor so that we look more righteousness than we really are, but keep part of the money for ourselves
We grab and claw and hoard for what we can because it feels like, if we don't get what's "due to us", we will miss out in this life.
An elixir guaranteed to give us 20 more years of life on this earth sounds like it's worth giving everything you've got to obtain
We want God to work more in our health and finances than in our hearts to change our perspective to match his.
God's perspective that we should adopt:
Life on earth is so short, meant only to give us enough time to fall in love with God and convince others to do the same.
What awaits us in heaven makes what we can amass here insignificant
Love matters more than anything. 
Whatever can increase real, honest, pure love is what we should pursue with everything we've got
Long life, health, wealth, success... Are only worth the risk of pride if love is increased

1 cor 7
V7 says we should come back to relations with the spouse to avoid temptation because of a lack of self control. Some might take this as permission to take a little heroine to stave off full-blown addiction. But marital sex is not sinful.
10:41
V14 the unbelieving spouse will be made holy because of the believing spouse. But not if the believer is nominal in partially committed.
10:43
V12 consents to live with... This is because people had converted to Christ and had changed. Maybe the unbelieving husband wouldn't want to live with them anymore. Or maybe the believer thinks they need to separate because they hear they should not be unequally yoked.

Byron Sommardahl  10:52 AM
But this doesn't give permission or blessing to marry a non believer and use "mission field" as an excuse.
V21 if you're a slave, dont sweat it. If you have the perspective of Jesus, you'll be able to live and serve in that station until you are called home in a short time.
Whatever your station in life, dedicate it to God and serve him where you are at.

V7 if you're single, it's a gift. Use it while you have it.

V17 we trust God that he has us in the life we have for a reason, and we need to be okay that reason might not include our on comfort or freedom.

The benefits of heaven overshadow and minimize even the most valuable benefits of this life. Biblical spiritual formation leads us to truly value the eternal more highly than the temporal.
Spiritual formation can be measured in the time it takes to come to our senses, regain an eternal perspective, and remember that the eternal matters more than the temporal.

Jonas had faith in God, but didn't want what God wanted. So, Jonas was on the spectrum of godliness, but still lacked a complete eternal perspective. For Jonas, God and heaven were real and within reach. But Jonas lacked the ability to see his earthly enemies as heavenly equals. He didn't want to share heaven with "them" and this demonstrated his spiritual immaturity (or at least a gap in his spiritual formation).




Mike preached about living an abundant life now during this earth, not just getting ready for eternity. I've heard this many times before. I'm listening for eternal perspective. 1 Corinthians 15

Though it's said we are made in god's image... Is that the physical us or another version?

Byron Sommardahl  2 months ago
Maybe in the resurrection, the part of us that is made in god's image is what we keep as the physical part stays in the ground.

Byron Sommardahl  2 months ago
We are corruptible now, but resurrection makes us incorruptible. Raised in glory so that we are only for and about the glory and presence of God.

Life now is a foretaste of eternity? Are we walking hints? Are we a preview for the upcoming movie?

Byron Sommardahl  2 months ago
The fall of Man (first Adam) was something God knew about and yet he created us. He did this because He is love. His expressed himself (love) in the gift of free will. Without this gift, we wouldn't have the capacity to truly love.
He loved his creation even with the knowledge it would betray him. And he gave us the ability to manifest love (manifest God) by choosing him despite our sinful nature and the challenges of living in this finite body. The only way for love to abound was if we had the capacity to choose, the capacity to betray, the capacity to forgive. And God expressed himself (his love) for us by making an unthinkable sacrifice to restore our relationship and magnify love... Our communal, triune God used his finite creation to put himself in a situation where he would be broken, fractured, separated from himself for 3 days while the son, alone and rejected for the first time in all eternity, defeated death.

John 10:10 talks about why Jesus came and mentions abundant life. We are so nearsighted and carnal that, of course, we think he's talking living well now, on this earth, during our 70 or 80 years. But I'm convinced Jesus is referring to eternal life... Why would Jesus care about how well we live right now? Compared to eternity, investing so much in living well during this life would seem like pissing away a gift. His whole mission was to point people to a deeper relationship with God and prepare people for resurrection and eternity. That's why Jesus came. (edited)

Maybe getting an incredible, comfortable life here on this Earth is kind of like putting on a miserable face when we're fasting and getting lots of pads on the back. We have already received our reward. Oooooooooooo, that's an uncomfortable thought.

Byron Sommardahl  2 months ago
Actually that kind of brings some new meaning to Jesus story about the rich man and Lazarus. And it also brings some more meaning to the Camel vs eye of the needle analogy. And it kind of explains why monks/nuns take a vow of poverty. Is it possible riches on earth decrease heavenly rewards? - 


James 1 talks about "the rich" compared to people who endure trials. That suggests the rich don't have trials, maybe because they solve the trials with money. Is this why it's so hard for the rich to go to heaven? The rich don't have as many chances to learn gods lessons and develop their hearts. The rich don't participate in sanctification??





Byron Sommardahl  1 month ago
I think we like to make "abundant life" about our earthly lives because we want to make Christianity marketable. We want it to compete well against other religions that promise happiness and peace in this life. We think God needs help to make Christianity more attractive. But, God doesn't need help and we're not doing people any favors. When they sign up for Christianity, they get in neck deep and start to realize it was a bait and switch. To live abundantly in this life (by earthly standards) you have to work just as hard, if not harder. We find that the house still costs what it costs. We find that we get to keep less money when we stop cheating on taxes. We find that we sweat just as much when we are out working under the sun. "But they told me I would have a better life. That God would help me."

Corey talked about it. "If this pastor thing fell apart, I should feel fine. Look at how blessed I am. My life is rich because of my family." I also feel rich, but I'm trying to look at things from an eternal perspective. We can enjoy things in this life, but we are each being pulled to a place where the presence of God will make all of these earthly riches and "blessings" feel so irrelevant. That's tough to say, but it's the reality. So then, how should we think of our family? My 2 year old daughter? My 7 year old? My 14 year old? My wife? My parents? My sister? I must get to the point where I can see them how God sees them... As precious people  that He wants in his presence during eternity. How is that different from how I see them today?

The Bible demonstrates apparent "changes of mind" but is that an actual change of gods mind? Did God encounter new information that was previously unavailable to him that required a change of mind? What's gods eternal perspective on his changes of mind in the Bible.
No, God did not make a mistake with his initial decision nor was there information that was unavailable to our all-knowing God. I believe the answer is in the difference between his perspective and ours. Like a child hearing a warning by his parent of an impending punishment, the beneficiaries of gods "change of mind"  had a child's perspective. God's perspective was closer to a parent's, with a desire to correct their behavior.

Byron Sommardahl  1 month ago
On the other hand, God absolutely does change how he treats us and works with us. Just like parents who treat their kids differently through the different stages of their kids lives, God works with the human race at the point where it's at, doing and saying what the human race needs.

Ema thinks I'm treating Nathan better than I treated him, but that's because ema had a limited and immature perspective. He can't remember that we treated him in similar ways, he doesn't take into consideration that every child needs custom treatment, and he doesn't think about the differences in how he acts/acted which definitely required very different responses from his parents.

We do the same thing with God when we assume God has changed over time. He used to be a bloodthirsty, angry war-loving God. Now he's a peace-loving, hippie God who wouldn't hurt an ant. The truth is God gives us (the human race) what we need, responding in kind to our output.


What's gods perspective on free will and his correction. (edited) 
1 reply

Byron Sommardahl  1 month ago
God gave us free will, or the ability to choose between loving him and or not. And he's all-knowing, so even though he gives us the "ability to choose", he knows already every decision we will make. To put this into today's context, it's as if we have watched a movie 10 times. The first time, we enjoyed the movie with new eyes, appreciating every conversation, attitude, decision and outcome without any fore-knowledge. The next few times, we might still want to plead with a character to make a better choice, knowing what's about to happen to them, but they do what you know they will do anyways. By the 10th time, you almost have the lines memorized, but you might still lament the outcomes and wish to go back and rewrite the script.
Maybe it's like a computer simulation of the spread of a virus through a petri dish. The simulation can run in 1 second with a powerful computer, even though the actual spread might take 48 hours. The simulation allows the scientist to see the entire 48 hours in one second.
I've heard gods temporal perspective described as viewing a tapestry. Every moment in time, viewed at once as if seeing a tapestry hung on a wall.
So why does God bother to correct us? It the answer found in some of the early ideas of predetermination? God has chosen those he will save?

Many times we are so wrapped up in one earthly, carnal experience and we miss the mission that God has for us. This carnal experience is not the only experience we will have, even though we often act and think that way. God's mission for us is to choose to love him and help others do the same.
This is easier to say from this moment in my life when I don't have to confront the murder of my child or some "horrible tragedy" (carnally speaking). But imagine having access to God's eternal perspective while in the middle of such a tragedy. Knowing that my child is just as precious to God as the murderer, realizing how short this carnal life is, knowing how real heaven is, and being aware of how little any of this tragedy will matter in eternity, I should be ready to roll up my sleeves and show gods love to that murderer in honest hopes to help him to also choose to love God and join my child and I in eternity!

We feel responsible to clean ourselves up if we're trying to be faithful to Jesus. That "obligation" we feel is natural, but I think it gets in god's way. We don't act as if we realize that God is taking charge of fixing us. We act as though, if we don't focus on removing that sin, no one else will. So, there's a puzzle here (for me).

I encountered this In prison ministry a lot. The guys would talk about how they need to get clean and somehow maintain their sin at bay, but how it almost never works and relapse feels like a sure thing... So why try? There's something there!! Maybe we shouldn't "try". The extreme would be to stop trying, let go of all inhibitions and just wait for God to magically zap sin out of us. Can God do that? Yes. Does God do that? Not in my experience and not really what the Bible describes as his normal behavior.

Considering Solomon was someone who had a ton of wisdom, how does his treatment of wisdom interact with God's eternal perspective. He said a lot of things were meaningless under the sun.

Being a part of the trinity, it makes complete sense that he had this perspective. To me this is what it means to be walking in the light.

What is God's perspective on friendship
1 reply

Byron Sommardahl  22 days ago
Friendship is something that can help us to act in the most godly ways without feeling the sacrifice. It makes the sacrifice seem small. Like the time we went to visit Ricardo in denver. We spent probably about $1,000 more and it took 2,000 miles of driving to get to him but, we were happy to do it because we knew we were going to be encouraging him. It also reminds me of the time that my roommate in college experience the death of his father. Someone at the college told me about his father's passing and I felt the need to drive out to his family's town and be there to encourage my roommate. It was a sacrifice on my part because I was a poor college student we got a lot of time or money. But, it encouraged him and I didn't really feel the sacrifice after all. I feel like God gives us these strong bonds of friendship as a tool so that we can come closer to doing his will on this Earth. In our frail state, we may not always think to serve people like God wants us to serve them without this touch of friendship. And, I think we might be tasting true spiritual maturity when we can act the same ways for people who are not our friends or for people who are even our enemies.

God's perspective on persecution?
1 reply

Byron Sommardahl  11 days ago
Our perspective is that we must avoid persecution, or that it's someone else's job to suffer. That's an American thing. Comfort is our goal and deity. But our eternal God sees our lives as temporary and NOT the goal. So if our lives are temporary and comfort is NOT the goal, then why should persecution be viewed as negative? Further, if persecution reveals intentions in such a pure way, why would God lament it if we were to endure it? He doesn't and even included it in the Bible. We are told that persecution is coming, and that persecution is a good thing. God endorses persecution. He approves of it! He WANTS it. So, if our attitude is to avoid persecution, could that attitude be rebellious and sinful?

So, it doesn't make sense that Jesus would be sad because of a sense of loss. I believe Jesus was demonstrating God's general response when we feel sad. He cares and he feels it with us. Much like a parent might empathize strongly with their children when they are genuinely sad. When my kids hearts are broken, I feel sadness with them because I love them. I can even empathize, if I permit myself, with kids or people who are not even that close to me... In a movie, I might cry because I am empathizing with the characters. We are made in god's image, and we do this. God did it first, so we do it because he does it.

We leave instructions on paper and make videos to show them around. We give them a way to check themselves in and get into the house. Everything is provided because we want the best for our guests. And we genuinely hope everything will work well for them, but if anything at all is not working, we truly hope they will reach out to us and let us help them. If they can't find where things are, we can help them find them. If they don't know how to use the equipment in the kitchen, we hope they will ask us to instruct them. 

Side note, do we respect rentals? There's a saying, "it's a rental," that basically means we don't really care much about the thing and don't really plan on caring for it. In fact, abuse is expected. Do we like to buy cars that were previously rentals? I was taught to steer clear. As I think of this life kind of like a rental, I am aware that there's a temptation to use it like I might a rental car… not caring too much about it, just looking for a joy ride, not really expecting to take good care of it.

Imagine we have an airbnb guest coming today. They're in the house and we have offered to help if they need anything, but we also respect their privacy. 

 I'm thinking of an Airbnb guest in my house welcoming me into my own house, giving me a tour and telling me about why things are placed where they are, all the while knowing I am actually the owner and the person who would really know why everything is where it is. But imagine another Airbnb guest who is using my kitchen equipment incorrectly, seeing that it's not working and humbly asking me to help them use it correctly and ultimately help them understand how to cook a meal in my kitchen.

This sounds like the pharasees trying to tell Jesus how the law works. Jesus made the law, do it's ridiculous. (Mark 3) This much is commonly accepted amongst christians. But there's a nuance that we miss. Jesus was not adding correctness to the law. He was removing what they had added incorrectly. 

There's something wrong with some of my previous attitudes and ideas about God and his interaction with me. I thought of it like I was adding God to my life, inviting him in and welcoming Him, as if this is my life in the first place. But it's actually the reverse. God is inviting me into his life, because I don't have a life of my own (whether I think I do or not).

We are not adding God to "our lives." God desires us to recognize our incompetence and dependence on God because it's US who is the guest here. God is adding US to "his life." We are the ones invited, not God. How might that change our reactions when things don't go out way? How might that change our attitudes when things are going well? How much do we deserve? How much do we appreciate? How dependent are we? Or are we planning on squatting in this house and never leaving? (good luck with that, by the way)

Humility comes from being a guest in someone else's house.

Casting our cares on God is about being dependent on Him.

1 Peter 5

Consequences are a form of grace. They prepare us for eternity.
What's gods perspective on our resistance to reading the Bible?



Thoughts

Jesus says it's better to take out your eye than go to hell?



What's gods perspective on our lives and the fact that we are alive now?
The only reason we are still alive is because he has a purpose for us or that we still have a chance to know him more.

Whats gods perspective on the Israelites and Jericho? 
Start chapter with story of people within the walls, living lives, slightly nervous about the shouting people outside the walls. meyhem, carnage, children dying.
Make the reader side with the people of Jericho without knowing who they are or who the antagonists are.
Reveal. That was gods people. Those are the people you have cheered on for years and as a kid in VBS. You used to be okay with this… what happened? Why were you okay with it before, feeling indignant while reading my story, and now you're just confused.
Maybe for the first time thinking about this story with fresh eyes, without the blurry layer of complacency you've grown up with. 
Now that you can see this in a different light, it's important to remember that this was commanded by our loving, all-powerful God. He told the Israelites to do this. 
If any of us were part of an invasion like that, we would be called barbaric, terrorist, unloving…
But that was the same god we serve. how can we reconcile that?
The answer might lie in gods perspective, and how he sees things compared to how we see/experience things.
We see human life as sacred. Does God?
We have only known this human life that we are experiencing now. We have only known temporary. We perceive our existence through the a temporal lense. To see things how God sees things, we have to make an intentional effort to think in unnatural ways, to look beyond the temporary.
We see the death of innocents as an abomination. We see any early death as wrong. Does God?
We see eternity as something abstract and abnormal. Does God?
What happened in Jerico was right. Period. But how?
For God, the loss of life on this Earth is only a transition. Even when kids die, it's a transition for God. The people in Jericho lost their lives, and for God, that was a transition. 
Maybe it was grace to the Israelites. If they had let the Canaanites live, they were going to corrupt the Israelites.


Whats gods perspective on people who say they're okay with going to hell.

Gods perspective on our desire to control our lives.

God's perspective on his Will.

God's perspective on his Kingdom.

God's perspective on spiritual warfare.
If there is a constant invisible battle going on, and God is all-powerful, then there must be some purpose for the battle beyond a real war where anyone could win or lose.

God's perspective on demon possession?
This one seems tough. If it's possible for demon's to possess someone, it's because God designed it to be possible. And that means there is a purpose. 
Why would Jesus honor the request of legion and not send them directly to hell? Could it be because God still had a purpose for demons to somehow contribute to our spiritual development and bring about his will?
Why was Jesus okay with killing the business and income of the owner of the pigs? That seems unjust. What was gods perspective on that situation? Haha, maybe the owner was Jewish by heritage, but was raising pigs against his beliefs to sell to gentiles. So, maybe Jesus was teaching that Jewish business man a lesson in integrity while also saving the demon-possessed man. Poetic justice would be that the demon-possessed man was formerly an employee of the business owner who formerly co-conspired with the business owner to disobey their beliefs. One lost years from his life, his family, his home, and his reputation. The other lost his property and livelihood.
In the case of Jesus and legion, the man who was freed from demons wanted to come with Jesus. He could have been a powerful disciple with a powerful testimony. The man lived in a region where he didn't have much hope of hearing more about god (evidenced by the pigs… not a Jewish area). Did he free the man just to leave him where he was and eventually perish? What was god's perspective here? Could it be that his new purpose was to say amen when the gospel later reached that region? Was Jesus planting a sleeper-cell to awaken after his resurrection?

God's perspective on our need to cover ourselves with clothing.

God's perspective on witchcraft.

God's perspective on the angels.

God's perspective on the fallen angels.

God's perspective on slavery.

God's perspective on homelessness.

Gods perspective on suffering.
The struggle with the "problem of suffering" comes from a temporal perspective. To us, as temporal beings, earthly, physical suffering is unjust and meaningless. But from an eternal perspective, suffering in this short life has eternal purpose and any feeling of pain or injustice is completely insignificant.
To God, suffering is a tool. The Bible even encourages us to seek it out!
Paul had a thorn. God had purpose for that suffering, and Paul had enough of gods eternal perspective to accept it.

Gods perspective on pride.
Pride is ugly to God and is opposite of his character. And since the purpose of this life is to prepare us for the next, pride threatens to halt or derail our spiritual formation and development.

God's perspective of spiritual obesity

God's perspective on how we see Jesus

God's perspective ony reputation
It's not important to him, except to the extent that he can use it to help people fall in love with him.

God's perspective on our minimal effort to stay out of hell



God's perspective on masculinity
Why did God choose men as the leader of the family and church?

God's perspective on the physical death of Jesus
Physical death was a smallish sacrifice, not to belittle the pain. But the physical sacrifice that we always focus on could never be enough to cover the sins of all the people of the world.



Gods perspective on abortion:
The biggest tragedy isn't the loss of the baby's life, but the selfishness of the mother and father for making a decision that attempts to escape responsibility.

I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I but Christ lives in me… that's something God does… why?
Does God transform us to improve our lives?
Does God change us because that's why he has us temporarily on this Earth, preparing us for eternity. We are here to fall in love with God and help others do the same. Changing us is simply a fulfilling of ½ of god's purpose for us. If we gives us more time to live, it's because we have time to do the other ½

God's perspective on our being content in singleness.
If I were God, I'd say "well, that's nice!" But really I'm sure God is proud because he knows we are available to his service.

The spiritusl high from youth camp… is there a connection between that feeling and adopting God's eternal perspective?


We say that God is sovereign almost like we are putting God on the throne. But the truth is that God is on the throne whether we choose to recognize it or not. And when we ignore Gods innate sovereignty, we are like kids who act like owners of the house and the parents are their servants.

God's perspective on fear and hysteria amongst human beings?

God's perspective on rulers he has put on the throne?
They're not always "good" from our perspective, but God uses them to advance His kingdom regardless.
A ruler might do things that seems to hurt Christian ideals (allowing gay marriage or abortions), but God is definitely working and all we have to do is trust that. It's not that "God might be working." It is that "God is definitely working."
A ruler can do things that kill the economy or give more money to the "wrong people" and we can still see that, through the lense of eternity, God uses that to teach people humility and to advance His kingdom.





Whats gods perspective on the situation when a person wanted to "bury his father" before following Jesus?
What does he mean "bury?"
Let the dead bury the dead



What's gods perspective on the people who wanted to follow Jesus because of miracles?
Jesus questioned people's motives when they followed him

God's perspective on our participation in the advance of his kingdom
God doesn't need us - the rocks could do it
God knows we need to serve in order to form us spiritually
Maybe God wants the human race to take responsibility (to a point) for the human race?

Characteristics of God

God's perspective on shaking the dust form your feet. 
Jesus said to do it
Is this giving up on those people?
Or is this more about the disciple who needs to let go of the responsibility and let God handle it?

God's perspective on us looking to him as our provider.
We can say that we can lose our jobs and that God will provide, but that's not exactly god's promise to us…bat least not how we understand it.
God might bring another job or some money, but his goals for us are eternal, not temporal. So providing us something in this life would always have an eternal purpose.

Gods perspective on men as leaders, women as submissive - Eph 5

God's perspective on weapons? Shane Claiborne, Tony campolo

God's perspective on execution on murderers. 

Wwjd bracelets got lots of people thinking.

I was watching my daughter draw a happy face, looking at her drawing as parents often do… not knowing what she was drawing but smiling and encouraging. Then I turned the drawing I'm my head and I could see the face, plain as day! I couldn't see what was being drawn because my perspective was wrong. But I changed my perspective and I was able to see more clearly.

Talking to JC, we often talk about how we put God first, but we don't know what that means practically. God, family, business… but while I'm working on business, I don't think about God.
