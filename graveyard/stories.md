## Stories

Story to hook reader
What happens when people donâ€™t think like God
Comparisons
Living well vs preparing for eternity
Being spiritual vs discovering/embracing spiritual nature that's already there
Persecution is avoidable vs persecution is desired (because it transforms)
Making God King vs realizing God was always my king and I was just blind
Sculpting David,making the stone look like David vs taking away that which was not David 
Behaving well vs surrendering to God
Studying for knowledge (or worse, superiority) vs studying for approval by God
Wanting heaven for the mansion vs wanting heaven for the presence of God
Will you be disappointed?
What if there was no mansion or reward? Would gods presence be enough for you?
Loving others because it's expected vs loving others because we see them how God the Father sees them
Serving in the church because it's expected by other humans vs serving because it's s chance to participate in helping others fall in love with God
Pray for healing vs pray for peace
Following Jesus for the fanfare or what I can receive on earth or following him because he's the guide to eternity
Want the HS for gifts or for transformation
Giving for recognition or becajde there is need (my need to release, their need to feel love)
Abstain from sin because I'll be punished or will lose something vs abstain from sin because its a complete waste of time as I am being prepared for eternity
Repent from sin because I don't want to lose my spot in heaven vs repent because I crave transformation and don't want to slow down the HS
Enraged by public sin of non-believers vs thankful that they have revealed their lostness like a flag and that someone/I might take the risk to share Christ with them
Hearing another boring sermon because I have to vs because I believe God can renew my mind even through a poor public speaker or boring sermon 
Fear judgement because it will reveal my secret sins vs accept judgement because it leads to purity and love and being in His presence 
Acting righteous for human approval vs being righteous because that's what God is making you
