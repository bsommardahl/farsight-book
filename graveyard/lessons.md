Matthew 25:14-30

[the kingdom of God]

14 “For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants[a] and entrusted to them his property. 15 To one he gave five talents,[b] to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. 16 He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. 17 So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. 18 But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. 

19 Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. 20 And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, I have made five talents more.’ 21 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant.[c] You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 22 And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; here, I have made two talents more.’ 23 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’

24 He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, 25 so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.’ 

26 But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed? 27 Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. 28 So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. 

29 For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. 30 And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’



1 Cor 11:17-34

17 In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. 18 In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. 19 No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God’s approval. 20 So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat, 21 for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk. 22 Don’t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? Certainly not in this matter!

17 Paul is not happy, Paul’s investment
18 Divisions (disagreements vs divisions)
19 the right differences, shows growth
20-21 should be the LS, but it’s YOUR supper (about you)
Some eating first, drinking all the wine
Some left hungry
Selfishness, not love, not about Jesus
22 despise (damaging) the church=humiliating the poor
How should we treat others? People who have less?
This is not just about the LS. We are called to put others first in all!
If we don’t, we are damaging the church

23 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, 24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.” 25 In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.” 26 For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.

23 Paul instructed by Jesus 
24- reminding the point
26 proclaim Jesus sacrifice, represent Jesus (be the church)

27 So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. 28 Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup. 29 For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves. 

27 unworthy manner? (Re 20-21) - baptism or selfishness?
The LS is about Jesus, but when we make it about ourselves, we take his place
Sinning against Jesus, body and blood
Think, we take the place of God is so much
Decisions, motives, disagreements, purchases, time
God allows us time to grow, amidst mistakes
But things supposedly directed at Him must actually be His, no one else
Ananias and Safaira, gave to church but made it about themselves (show)
28 examine yourselves, is this for me or for Jesus?
29 LS for any other than Jesus=Judgement, showing your guilt

30 That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. 31 But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves, we would not come under such judgment. 32 Nevertheless, when we are judged in this way by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world.

30 weak, sick, asleep - spiritually…
Discernment, see what God sees, between right and wrong, honest
Acting without discernment, ignoring God
It won’t work for long
31 avoid guilt/judgement by being honest about who you are and allowing god to transform you
32 grace: god is willing to discipline us and grow us

33 So then, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, you should all eat together. 34 Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment.

33 eat together (simultaneously?) - all with the same focus/reason (Jesus)
34 if you’re coming to serve yourself, do it elsewhere
When the focus is supposed to be on God, leave it there, don’t take it for yourself

What can we learn?
God wants the spotlight
God does not share the focus
The LS is special and cannot be about us
God values need, not selfishness
God wants to fulfill needs, not selfish desires
God gives us time, but expects us to grow up

Is it time for you to grow up? Maybe you need help taking the first step?
