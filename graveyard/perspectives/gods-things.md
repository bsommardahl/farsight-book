### Demons

They were more visibly active in Bible times. Some countries seem to have more visible activity even today. God is all-powerful, so why did God allow demons to exist. Do they have a purpose? They must, if God allowed them.

We're demons active in the old testament? Were they commonplace in the days Jesus was on earth?

They recognized Jesus. Did the demons understand the significance of the son of god walking on earth?

When we sin, we often blame demons or Satan, but in reality, we don't need demons to be evil... We can do that on our own.

God kicked demons out of heaven. Jesus kicked demons out of people during his ministry. Jesus followers kick demons out of people. Demons keep getting kicked out.

### His Will

### His Kingdom

### Spiritual Warfare

If there is a constant invisible battle going on, and God is all-powerful, then there must be some purpose for the battle beyond a real war where anyone could win or lose.

### Demon Possession

This one seems tough. If it's possible for demon's to possess someone, it's because God designed it to be possible. And that means there is a purpose. 

Why would Jesus honor the request of legion and not send them directly to hell? Could it be because God still had a purpose for demons to somehow contribute to our spiritual development and bring about his will?

Why was Jesus okay with killing the business and income of the owner of the pigs? That seems unjust. What was gods perspective on that situation? Haha, maybe the owner was Jewish by heritage, but was raising pigs against his beliefs to sell to gentiles. So, maybe Jesus was teaching that Jewish business man a lesson in integrity while also saving the demon-possessed man. Poetic justice would be that the demon-possessed man was formerly an employee of the business owner who formerly co-conspired with the business owner to disobey their beliefs. One lost years from his life, his family, his home, and his reputation. The other lost his property and livelihood.

In the case of Jesus and legion, the man who was freed from demons wanted to come with Jesus. He could have been a powerful disciple with a powerful testimony. The man lived in a region where he didn't have much hope of hearing more about god (evidenced by the pigs… not a Jewish area). Did he free the man just to leave him where he was and eventually perish? What was god's perspective here? Could it be that his new purpose was to say amen when the gospel later reached that region? Was Jesus planting a sleeper-cell to awaken after his resurrection?

### Witchcraft.

### Angels.

### Fallen Angels

### God's Transformative Work In Our Hearts

I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I but Christ lives in me… that's something God does… why?

Does God transform us to improve our lives?

Does God change us because that's why he has us temporarily on this Earth, preparing us for eternity. We are here to fall in love with God and help others do the same. Changing us is simply a fulfilling of ½ of god's purpose for us. If we gives us more time to live, it's because we have time to do the other ½
