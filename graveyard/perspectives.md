## God's Perspective

How does God view culture?

## God's Perspective

### What does God think about balance?

Obviously living on the negative extreme is bad. Living on the positive extreme feels unattainable, so we resort to finding balance. Is that what we mean? Hope not... That sounds like something God would spit out (lukewarm). (edited) 

Liberal vs conservative... We should be in the middle? Maybe, but only because that's where we can serve God best, or where God can use us best to advance his kingdom. But it's not about getting the best RoI.

Spiritual vs carnal... Should we be in the middle?

Financially wealthy vs poor... In the middle? Is it as simple as giving enough to offset our comforts? Is that the balance we should seek?

### How blessed should Christians feel when they think about their families and earthly lives?

Corey talked about it. "If this pastor thing fell apart, I should feel fine. Look at how blessed I am. My life is rich because of my family." I also feel rich, but I'm trying to look at things from an eternal perspective. We can enjoy things in this life, but we are each being pulled to a place where the presence of God will make all of these earthly riches and "blessings" feel so irrelevant. That's tough to say, but it's the reality. So then, how should we think of our family? My 2 year old daughter? My 7 year old? My 14 year old? My wife? My parents? My sister? I must get to the point where I can see them how God sees them... As precious people  that He wants in his presence during eternity. How is that different from how I see them today?

So I want challenge the idea that we should regard our own family higher than anyone else. All are equally precious to God. Jesus illustrated this when he answered the people who said "your mother and brothers are outside."


### Does God change?

Does the Bible demonstrate that God changes over time? Saying that God changes suggests that God had a character flaw that he discovered and improved.


### Does God change his mind?

The Bible demonstrates apparent "changes of mind" but is that an actual change of gods mind? Did God encounter new information that was previously unavailable to him that required a change of mind? What's gods eternal perspective on his changes of mind in the Bible.

No, God did not make a mistake with his initial decision nor was there information that was unavailable to our all-knowing God. I believe the answer is in the difference between his perspective and ours. Like a child hearing a warning by his parent of an impending punishment, the beneficiaries of gods "change of mind"  had a child's perspective. God's perspective was closer to a parent's, with a desire to correct their behavior.

On the other hand, God absolutely does change how he treats us and works with us. Just like parents who treat their kids differently through the different stages of their kids lives, God works with the human race at the point where it's at, doing and saying what the human race needs.

Ema thinks I'm treating Nathan better than I treated him, but that's because ema had a limited and immature perspective. He can't remember that we treated him in similar ways, he doesn't take into consideration that every child needs custom treatment, and he doesn't think about the differences in how he acts/acted which definitely required very different responses from his parents.

We do the same thing with God when we assume God has changed over time. He used to be a bloodthirsty, angry war-loving God. Now he's a peace-loving, hippie God who wouldn't hurt an ant. The truth is God gives us (the human race) what we need, responding in kind to our output.


## What's gods perspective on free will and his correction. (edited) 

God gave us free will, or the ability to choose between loving him and or not. And he's all-knowing, so even though he gives us the "ability to choose", he knows already every decision we will make. To put this into today's context, it's as if we have watched a movie 10 times. The first time, we enjoyed the movie with new eyes, appreciating every conversation, attitude, decision and outcome without any fore-knowledge. The next few times, we might still want to plead with a character to make a better choice, knowing what's about to happen to them, but they do what you know they will do anyways. By the 10th time, you almost have the lines memorized, but you might still lament the outcomes and wish to go back and rewrite the script.
Maybe it's like a computer simulation of the spread of a virus through a petri dish. The simulation can run in 1 second with a powerful computer, even though the actual spread might take 48 hours. The simulation allows the scientist to see the entire 48 hours in one second.
I've heard gods temporal perspective described as viewing a tapestry. Every moment in time, viewed at once as if seeing a tapestry hung on a wall.
So why does God bother to correct us? It the answer found in some of the early ideas of predetermination? God has chosen those he will save?



## Yet to be catalogged

## What was gods perspective on Job?

God had an actual conversation with Satan!? God offered Job up to Satan like a social experiment?! If I have a carnal perspective, this story feels very unfair. If this life is all there is, it feels unjust that God would allow suffering, and incurably I just that he would invite it!!!!

Basically, thanks to God, Job lost all he had worked for, lost his family and friends, lost his comfort and his ability to provide for himself. -- thanks to God's little worm, Jonah lost his shade tree and got sunburn.

## If someone killed my child and then God asked me to take the gospel to them, what are my options?

Jonah hated the Samaritans so much he repeatedly rebelled against God and denied his orders.

In Jonah's complaint near the end of the story, Jonah said he didn't want to preach to them because he knew they would change and God would "change his mind" and not destroy their city.

So, I would have the same options as Jonah, and perhaps the same mindset. If this person killed my child, could I honestly desire to see them in heaven? What's gods'perspective on that?

Many times we are so wrapped up in one earthly, carnal experience and we miss the mission that God has for us. This carnal experience is not the only experience we will have, even though we often act and think that way. God's mission for us is to choose to love him and help others do the same.

This is easier to say from this moment in my life when I don't have to confront the murder of my child or some "horrible tragedy" (carnally speaking). But imagine having access to God's eternal perspective while in the middle of such a tragedy. Knowing that my child is just as precious to God as the murderer, realizing how short this carnal life is, knowing how real heaven is, and being aware of how little any of this tragedy will matter in eternity, I should be ready to roll up my sleeves and show gods love to that murderer in honest hopes to help him to also choose to love God and join my child and I in eternity!

I should ask John mark hicks about this. He lost someone in his family.

I should speak with the author of the shack, since he was definitely trying to illustrate gods perspective AND gods way of loving us through problems like the loss of a child.

## What's god's perspective on "dealing with Sin" as in the old testament (animal sacrifice, roll sins forward)?

What was God seeing in humanity through sacrifices? What did he hope we would get from it, since God clearly didn't get anything from it?


## What is gods perspective on the role of the HS in our lives once we accept him and receive the HS?

## What was gods perspective on the Hebrew people a king, when they complained?

Was he giving in and giving up? Or was he proving a painful object lesson?


## What's God's perspective on our efforts to manage our sin?

We feel responsible to clean ourselves up if we're trying to be faithful to Jesus. That "obligation" we feel is natural, but I think it gets in god's way. We don't act as if we realize that God is taking charge of fixing us. We act as though, if we don't focus on removing that sin, no one else will. So, there's a puzzle here (for me).

I encountered this In prison ministry a lot. The guys would talk about how they need to get clean and somehow maintain their sin at bay, but how it almost never works and relapse feels like a sure thing... So why try? There's something there!! Maybe we shouldn't "try". The extreme would be to stop trying, let go of all inhibitions and just wait for God to magically zap sin out of us. Can God do that? Yes. Does God do that? Not in my experience and not really what the Bible describes as his normal behavior.

The churchy extreme is to get organized and systematically eliminate sin. Like it's project plan or backlog, prioritize by value or impact and start knocking it out. Go to counselors or shrinks to psych it out of us (or hypnotize). One by one, sin by sin, becoming more and more perfect. If you think That's actually working for you, I'd say you are in danger of replacing Jesus

Could this be one of the major problems for the American church? We are so focused on self help and self development.

If I'm right? How can Christians practically put this into practice.. it probably doesn't have to do with doing more... It has to do with reframing and doing less, but how?


## What is God's perspective on patience and wisdom?

I've always thought of patience as something that could help me in this life, but I think there ismore passed into God's perspective.

Really patience is not so I can make better decisions general but to help me hold on and resist sin.

In the same way, wisdom is not so that I can get more of what I want but so that I can be more attentive to God's perspective. Maybe God's adopting God's eternal perspective is akin to growing in wisdom.

Considering Solomon was someone who had a ton of wisdom, how does his treatment of wisdom interact with God's eternal perspective. He said a lot of things were meaningless under the sun. It seems like as he was adopting God eternal perspective, he was struggling with the realization that a lot of his previous urgency was not really that important after all.



## What is God's perspective on walking in the light as he is in the light

What does it mean that Jesus was walking in the light? Does that mean he was enlightened or that he had clarity of vision? It seems like it could mean that he had a grasp on the father's perspective that it gave an incredible clarity and light to his motives, decisions footsteps and everything he did have thought.

Being a part of the trinity, it makes complete sense that he had this perspective. To me this is what it means to be walking in the light. And so, if we want to walk in the light as he is in the light, then we should also try to discover and adopt is the same perspective so that we can have clarity like he had clarity.


## What was God's perspective on the widow who gave her last cent

What was it what about her that called jesus's attention so much? Was it because she was demonstrating her dependence on God, did she truly trust that God was going to provide her next meal or that it didn't matter whether God get exactly that or not but that God would still be glorified in the end?


## What is God's perspective on friendship

Friendship is something that can help us to act in the most godly ways without feeling the sacrifice. It makes the sacrifice seem small. Like the time we went to visit Ricardo in denver. We spent probably about $1,000 more and it took 2,000 miles of driving to get to him but, we were happy to do it because we knew we were going to be encouraging him. It also reminds me of the time that my roommate in college experience the death of his father. Someone at the college told me about his father's passing and I felt the need to drive out to his family's town and be there to encourage my roommate. It was a sacrifice on my part because I was a poor college student we got a lot of time or money. But, it encouraged him and I didn't really feel the sacrifice after all. I feel like God gives us these strong bonds of friendship as a tool so that we can come closer to doing his will on this Earth. In our frail state, we may not always think to serve people like God wants us to serve them without this touch of friendship. And, I think we might be tasting true spiritual maturity when we can act the same ways for people who are not our friends or for people who are even our enemies.



## We talk like the gospel revolves around us, when in reality, we are walking as guests around the gospel.

Christians make comments about God and the gospel as if we are the owners of something with rights. But in reality I we are guests and we have the opportunity to interact with something that gives us access to the presence of God.

If you think sin is worth sacrificing eternity or a relationship with God, then you don't truly understand eternity.
1 reply

If you think eternity isn't worth sacrificing this life, then you don't understand eternity.

## Whats gods perspective on cultures?

We have this thing called culture and we act as if it's a standard of living. In reality, worldly culture is a distraction from what God has for us. We say we need to be counter-cultural, but I'm it sure that's really it. Instead of thinking of the culture as an immovable, permanent thing, perhaps we need to think of it as an unwelcome blanket that we can lift away from us and our context.


## What's gods perspective on ownership?

Did the native Indians have something right about an attitude of "not owning anything". Jesus didn't claim to own much. He even made a point to say that he didn't have a home to call his own.

## What's gods perspective on rights?

The Bible teaches us to submit and lay down our desires. But our rights are unalienable, irrevocable.... They're rights for goodness sake. Doesn't God want us to have our rights respected? No, he doesn't. Rights are all about each individual, his comfort, his space, his property, his life. And from an eternal perspective, does any of that matter at all?? No way!



## What's gods perspective on people who want to change the world?

I've said I want to do this. I too have delusions of grandeur, that I could actually do something that would change the world. And what if I did accomplish something like that? Will it matter when I'm gone? Only if God desires it to matter. Only if God wants to use my impact?... Only if it's gods impact.


## God's perspective on persecution?

Our perspective is that we must avoid persecution, or that it's someone else's job to suffer. That's an American thing. Comfort is our goal and deity. But our eternal God sees our lives as temporary and NOT the goal. So if our lives are temporary and comfort is NOT the goal, then why should persecution be viewed as negative? Further, if persecution reveals intentions in such a pure way, why would God lament it if we were to endure it? He doesn't and even included it in the Bible. We are told that persecution is coming, and that persecution is a good thing. God endorses persecution. He approves of it! He WANTS it. So, if our attitude is to avoid persecution, could that attitude be rebellious and sinful?



## What was gods perspective on the the flood?

Did God see the human race as one unit, and was the flood an act of mercy to save the human race?


## What's gods perspective on my financial security?

Right now, I'm on shaky ground financially. The economy is going into a recession and I don't have a job. My businesses are not working so well. When I pray, should I pray that God magically make something work? Does God want me to have financial security? Maybe... To the extent that He can use my financial security to advance His kingdom.

God wants to BE my stability.


## What's gods perspective on marriage?

He can use marriage to teach us how to love sacrificially.

Submission is a mental state God wants for us.



## What's gods perspective on the execution of Jesus? Stephen? What was Jesus and Stephens perspectives?

Earthly life is temporary.

Earthly death is not an earth-shattering event, though we lock on death and treat it as the climax. Jesus perspective was forgiveness. His gaze was on the lowly humans who were so misguided and confused that they ended his life. Stephen had a similar perspective. As they took his earthly life, he had such a firm grasp on eternity that his attention was on his fellow humans who still had not acquired that perspective.

We view our earthly lives as our most precious possession. We consider this life as our reality. And why wouldn't we? This is all we have ever experienced.

But God knows the truth.


## What's gods perspective on demons?

They were more visibly active in Bible times. Some countries seem to have more visible activity even today. God is all-powerful, so why did God allow demons to exist. Do they have a purpose? They must, if God allowed them.

We're demons active in the old testament? Were they commonplace in the days Jesus was on earth?

They recognized Jesus. Did the demons understand the significance of the son of god walking on earth?

When we sin, we often blame demons or Satan, but in reality, we don't need demons to be evil... We can do that on our own.

God kicked demons out of heaven. Jesus kicked demons out of people during his ministry. Jesus followers kick demons out of people. Demons keep getting kicked out.


## What's gods perspective on our abilities?

I can do all things through Christ.

Say to that mountain move, and it will move.

Miracles

Gifts

We can build massive churches and raise millions of dollars. We can build companies that form our earthly culture. We can teach people to do anything. We can invent anything. We can cure almost any disease. How does God view all our "incredible" abilities? I believe God sees us as children, playing with and discovering thing they only barely understand. And when we feel proud of our accomplishments, God sees us as children proud of a mud pie (with love and care, but not impressed).

But when we become self-righteous or big-hearted because of our accomplishments, God sees us as children who don't understand what they are doing and need correction.


## What's gods perspective on our sadness and depression?

Jesus wept.

Did Jesus cry because he felt loss? Jesus, with his eternal perspective, knew Lazarus was completing his mission and would be in heaven. So, it doesn't make sense that Jesus would be sad because of a sense of loss. I believe Jesus was demonstrating God's general response when we feel sad. He cares and he feels it with us. Much like a parent might empathize strongly with their children when they are genuinely sad. When my kids hearts are broken, I feel sadness with them because I love them. I can even empathize, if I permit myself, with kids or people who are not even that close to me... In a movie, I might cry because I am empathizing with the characters. We are made in god's image, and we do this. God did it first, so we do it because he does it.

I feel love magnified when I am empathizing with someone who is deeply sad. In the funeral line, I might hug and cry with a cousin I haven't even seen in years. Did love increase? Maybe. Do I feel love more intensely when I'm empathizing. You bet!


## What's gods perspective on our requests made in prayer?

I've heard preacher's say we treat God like a celestial bellboy.

Do we treat God like a waiter at a restaurant?

Jesus came to serve, not be served.

God probably sees our requests like a child asking for something in the checkout line.



## What's gods perspective on Mormons and Jehovah's witnesses and other flavors just outside the mainstream?

## What's gods perspective on our denominations?


## What's gods perspective on miracles?

Jesus did miracles, but it wasn't his purpose. He came to show the human race what God wants with them, which is not learned through fanfare and showy stuff. Jesus did miracles to get attention or to care for people, but he preferred that they learned about god more than oohs and ahh's.


## What's gods perspective on sexuality Or gender or sexual identity?

God sees us as children. Children sometimes believe something about themselves that's not true. This doesn't change what God wants from them.

We treat our identity as a hill to die on. Sexuality and gender too. God calls us to purity, which results sacrifice for EVERYONE. Everyone has to sacrifice their desires to follow Jesus. So, if a lesbian wants to follow Jesus, she must sacrifice her sinful desires. If a man believes he should have been a woman, and wants to follow Jesus, he must sacrifice his sinful desires. If a hetero man wants to sleep around, but also wants to follow Jesus, he must sacrifice his sinful desires.

Culture is telling us to protect and insist on our "true identity". But God defines truth.

And no matter what, followers of Jesus are called to hold on to faith, seek first the kingdom and live loyally to Jesus until earthly death. Whatever we want for ourselves is irrelevant and possibly a distraction that needs to be removed. The only thing that really matters in this life is serving God.

But somehow we believe it is a human right to act on our desires. If the desire doesn't go away, then it must mean it's meant to be there and to be given in to. But our rights are defined by God, not our feelings. And God doesn't always take away desires... He knows we need things to keep us honest, humble and dependent on him.


## What's gods perspective on the old testament law?

The ot law was given to provide guardrails to the human race, incapable of determining their own limits. Like children, the human race didn't have the capacity to have fuzzy limits, so God gave them clear limits.

The NT law provides fuzzy limits. Does that mean the human race is ready to determine its own guardrails?

I make rules or give chores sometimes because I want to teach obedience. Does God do that with us? Does he give us rules to follow even when it doesn't actually matter, other than to teach us to obey him no matter what?


## What's goes perspective on provision?

We often talk about how God will provide in various situations. We pray for God to give us a job, fill out bank accounts, give us what we need. Jesus modeled this in his prayer, asking God to provide today's bread.


## 1 Peter 3:13 says "harm you"? Was Jesus harmed?

Forms who's perspective?


## What's gods perspective on our management of sin?

Is our sin management just our maintaining some sins on the side?

Or is it more nefarious than that? I think sin management is much more widespread because we often act as if we are the only ones who can or should work on reducing or removing sin. We don't act as if we truly believe God has a part in changing our hearts, so we don't expect any activity from God.


## What's gods perspective on vengeance?

We are to love enemies.


## What's gods perspective on judgement?

Book of life, we will be judged. This is the filtering of those who will go to heaven.

We also judge other followers to instruct. The Bible judges us during our lives to instruct. So sometimes judgement is for instruction, and other times it's final.

## What's gods perspective on blessings?

1 Peter 4:12-19 if you're ridiculed, you're blessed. How so? Is a blessing something I can enjoy? I don't enjoy ridicule. So is a blessing something I get, like a car or some money? Or is a blessing more about God's approval, as in a father blessing a guy to marry his daughter?

I'm not comfortable claiming blessings when I know I don't deserve God's approval.

## What's gods perspective on the refiner's fire?

We often despise or avoid the refiner's fire.

God's refining fire could be this life. We are being tried and our impurities are bring separated out.

If we resist the fire now, we are living short sightedly because it's the whole point of this life.


## "Myopic Christianity"

## What's gods perspective in the book of ester?

## What's gods perspective of us welcoming him into our world and lives?

We have our house on Airbnb and offer it for rent when we go on long trips to Honduras. It's an odd feeling, having people renting and making our home their own for a time. Thank goodness it has gone well so far, but it's still odd. And I have learned an interesting lesson from this experience and I believe it has shown me a bit of God's perspective of us inhabiting this earth that he is renting us for a time.

We typically go overboard preparing for guests. We clean more than we ever would for ourselves. We organize things that we normally leave in disarray. We stock the cabinets and the fridge. We leave instructions on paper and make videos to show them around. We give them a way to check themselves in and get into the house. Everything is provided because we want the best for our guests. And we genuinely hope everything will work well for them, but if anything at all is not working, we truly hope they will reach out to us and let us help them. If they can't find where things are, we can help them find them. If they don't know how to use the equipment in the kitchen, we hope they will ask us to instruct them. 

Side note, do we respect rentals? There's a saying, "it's a rental," that basically means we don't really care much about the thing and don't really plan on caring for it. In fact, abuse is expected. Do we like to buy cars that were previously rentals? I was taught to steer clear. As I think of this life kind of like a rental, I am aware that there's a temptation to use it like I might a rental car… not caring too much about it, just looking for a joy ride, not really expecting to take good care of it.

Imagine we have an airbnb guest coming today. They're in the house and we have offered to help if they need anything, but we also respect their privacy. 

I'm thinking of an Airbnb guest in my house welcoming me into my own house, giving me a tour and telling me about why things are placed where they are, all the while knowing I am actually the owner and the person who would really know why everything is where it is. But imagine another Airbnb guest who is using my kitchen equipment incorrectly, seeing that it's not working and humbly asking me to help them use it correctly and ultimately help them understand how to cook a meal in my kitchen.

This sounds like the pharasees trying to tell Jesus how the law works. Jesus made the law, do it's ridiculous. (Mark 3) This much is commonly accepted amongst christians. But there's a nuance that we miss. Jesus was not adding correctness to the law. He was removing what they had added incorrectly. 

There's something wrong with some of my previous attitudes and ideas about God and his interaction with me. I thought of it like I was adding God to my life, inviting him in and welcoming Him, as if this is my life in the first place. But it's actually the reverse. God is inviting me into his life, because I don't have a life of my own (whether I think I do or not).

We are not adding God to "our lives." God desires us to recognize our incompetence and dependence on God because it's US who is the guest here. God is adding US to "his life." We are the ones invited, not God. How might that change our reactions when things don't go out way? How might that change our attitudes when things are going well? How much do we deserve? How much do we appreciate? How dependent are we? Or are we planning on squatting in this house and never leaving? (good luck with that, by the way)

Humility comes from being a guest in someone else's house.

## Casting our cares on God is about being dependent on Him.


## Consequences are a form of grace. They prepare us for eternity.

## What's gods perspective on our resistance to reading the Bible? 1 Peter 5


## Jesus says it's better to take out your eye than go to hell?



## What's gods perspective on our lives and the fact that we are alive now?

The only reason we are still alive is because he has a purpose for us or that we still have a chance to know him more.

## Whats gods perspective on the Israelites and Jericho? 

Start chapter with story of people within the walls, living lives, slightly nervous about the shouting people outside the walls. meyhem, carnage, children dying.
Make the reader side with the people of Jericho without knowing who they are or who the antagonists are.

Reveal. That was gods people. Those are the people you have cheered on for years and as a kid in VBS. You used to be okay with this… what happened? Why were you okay with it before, feeling indignant while reading my story, and now you're just confused.

Maybe for the first time thinking about this story with fresh eyes, without the blurry layer of complacency you've grown up with. 

Now that you can see this in a different light, it's important to remember that this was commanded by our loving, all-powerful God. He told the Israelites to do this. 

If any of us were part of an invasion like that, we would be called barbaric, terrorist, unloving…

But that was the same god we serve. how can we reconcile that?

The answer might lie in gods perspective, and how he sees things compared to how we see/experience things.

## We see human life as sacred. Does God?

We have only known this human life that we are experiencing now. We have only known temporary. We perceive our existence through the a temporal lense. To see things how God sees things, we have to make an intentional effort to think in unnatural ways, to look beyond the temporary.

We see the death of innocents as an abomination. We see any early death as wrong. Does God?

We see eternity as something abstract and abnormal. Does God?

What happened in Jerico was right. Period. But how?

For God, the loss of life on this Earth is only a transition. Even when kids die, it's a transition for God. The people in Jericho lost their lives, and for God, that was a transition. 

Maybe it was grace to the Israelites. If they had let the Canaanites live, they were going to corrupt the Israelites.


## Whats gods perspective on people who say they're okay with going to hell.

## Gods perspective on our desire to control our lives.

## God's perspective on his Will.

## God's perspective on his Kingdom.

## God's perspective on spiritual warfare.

If there is a constant invisible battle going on, and God is all-powerful, then there must be some purpose for the battle beyond a real war where anyone could win or lose.

## God's perspective on demon possession?

This one seems tough. If it's possible for demon's to possess someone, it's because God designed it to be possible. And that means there is a purpose. 

Why would Jesus honor the request of legion and not send them directly to hell? Could it be because God still had a purpose for demons to somehow contribute to our spiritual development and bring about his will?

Why was Jesus okay with killing the business and income of the owner of the pigs? That seems unjust. What was gods perspective on that situation? Haha, maybe the owner was Jewish by heritage, but was raising pigs against his beliefs to sell to gentiles. So, maybe Jesus was teaching that Jewish business man a lesson in integrity while also saving the demon-possessed man. Poetic justice would be that the demon-possessed man was formerly an employee of the business owner who formerly co-conspired with the business owner to disobey their beliefs. One lost years from his life, his family, his home, and his reputation. The other lost his property and livelihood.

In the case of Jesus and legion, the man who was freed from demons wanted to come with Jesus. He could have been a powerful disciple with a powerful testimony. The man lived in a region where he didn't have much hope of hearing more about god (evidenced by the pigs… not a Jewish area). Did he free the man just to leave him where he was and eventually perish? What was god's perspective here? Could it be that his new purpose was to say amen when the gospel later reached that region? Was Jesus planting a sleeper-cell to awaken after his resurrection?

## God's perspective on our need to cover ourselves with clothing.

## God's perspective on witchcraft.

## God's perspective on the angels.

## God's perspective on the fallen angels.

## God's perspective on slavery.

## God's perspective on homelessness.

## Gods perspective on suffering.

The struggle with the "problem of suffering" comes from a temporal perspective. To us, as temporal beings, earthly, physical suffering is unjust and meaningless. But from an eternal perspective, suffering in this short life has eternal purpose and any feeling of pain or injustice is completely insignificant.

To God, suffering is a tool. The Bible even encourages us to seek it out!

Paul had a thorn. God had purpose for that suffering, and Paul had enough of gods eternal perspective to accept it.

## Gods perspective on pride.

Pride is ugly to God and is opposite of his character. And since the purpose of this life is to prepare us for the next, pride threatens to halt or derail our spiritual formation and development.

## God's perspective of spiritual obesity

## God's perspective on how we see Jesus

## God's perspective ony reputation

It's not important to him, except to the extent that he can use it to help people fall in love with him.

## God's perspective on our minimal effort to stay out of hell


## God's perspective on masculinity

Why did God choose men as the leader of the family and church?

## God's perspective on the physical death of Jesus
Physical death was a smallish sacrifice, not to belittle the pain. But the physical sacrifice that we always focus on could never be enough to cover the sins of all the people of the world.


## Gods perspective on abortion:

The biggest tragedy isn't the loss of the baby's life, but the selfishness of the mother and father for making a decision that attempts to escape responsibility.

## I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I but Christ lives in me… that's something God does… why?

Does God transform us to improve our lives?

Does God change us because that's why he has us temporarily on this Earth, preparing us for eternity. We are here to fall in love with God and help others do the same. Changing us is simply a fulfilling of ½ of god's purpose for us. If we gives us more time to live, it's because we have time to do the other ½

## God's perspective on our being content in singleness.

If I were God, I'd say "well, that's nice!" But really I'm sure God is proud because he knows we are available to his service.

The spiritusl high from youth camp… is there a connection between that feeling and adopting God's eternal perspective?

## Guests in someone elses house

We say that God is sovereign almost like we are putting God on the throne. But the truth is that God is on the throne whether we choose to recognize it or not. And when we ignore Gods innate sovereignty, we are like kids who act like owners of the house and the parents are their servants.

## God's perspective on fear and hysteria amongst human beings?

## God's perspective on rulers he has put on the throne?

They're not always "good" from our perspective, but God uses them to advance His kingdom regardless.

A ruler might do things that seems to hurt Christian ideals (allowing gay marriage or abortions), but God is definitely working and all we have to do is trust that. It's not that "God might be working." It is that "God is definitely working."

A ruler can do things that kill the economy or give more money to the "wrong people" and we can still see that, through the lense of eternity, God uses that to teach people humility and to advance His kingdom.

## God's perspective on our participation in the advance of his kingdom

- God doesn't need us - the rocks could do it
- God knows we need to serve in order to form us spiritually
- Maybe God wants the human race to take responsibility (to a point) for the human race?

## God's perspective on shaking the dust form your feet. 
Jesus said to do it
Is this giving up on those people?
Or is this more about the disciple who needs to let go of the responsibility and let God handle it?

## God's perspective on us looking to him as our provider.

We can say that we can lose our jobs and that God will provide, but that's not exactly god's promise to us…bat least not how we understand it.

God might bring another job or some money, but his goals for us are eternal, not temporal. So providing us something in this life would always have an eternal purpose.

## God's perspective on weapons? Shane Claiborne, Tony campolo

## God's perspective on execution on murderers. 

## Wwjd bracelets 
got lots of people thinking. (not sure where I was going here)

## We have incomplete perspectives

I was watching my daughter draw a happy face, looking at her drawing as parents often do… not knowing what she was drawing but smiling and encouraging. Then I turned the drawing I'm my head and I could see the face, plain as day! I couldn't see what was being drawn because my perspective was wrong. But I changed my perspective and I was able to see more clearly.

## "Putting God First"
Talking to JC, we often talk about how we put God first, but we don't know what that means practically. God, family, business… but while I'm working on business, I don't think about God.
