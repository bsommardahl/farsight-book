## Old Outlines

### Outline
Concept: God wants to give us his perspective
What is heaven?
What is wisdom?
What is sanctification?
What is the kingdom of god?
Both present and future? http://hermeneutics.kulikovskyonline.net/hermeneutics/sermmt.pdf
God has always wanted to bring us into his presence. That is heaven in a nutshell: being eternally and fully in the presence of god. He created us to fall in love with him by choice and join him eternally in his presence. 
Our time on earth is meant to purify us (refiners fire) and prepare us for eternity. That preparation is the process of sanctification (renewing of the mind). 
The kingdom of god the reign, authority, sovereignty of God… it exists whether or not we want it to or recognize it. We cannot bring it into existence or manifest it because it already exists. Theologians think of it as present and future because of their perspective. If you think of something existing only when you can see or feel it, then The kingdom is maybe now or maybe not… or maybe it only exists over there, but not here. But the reality is it’s everywhere and has been for all time. 
“Your kingdom come” refers to our ability to see it. This is in the same sense as “a thought came to me.” We can advance the kingdom of God by helping more people see it and join it. 
The subjects of the kingdom of god are a worldwide community made up of people who have surrendered to Gods sovereignty… the church. The church grows as the numbers of subjects, but the kingdom of God is still the same size since Gods sovereignty is complete with or without subjects… if not us, then the rocks.
