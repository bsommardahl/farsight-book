## As our perspective is replaced by His, we begin to 

1. trust Him more
  1. Define “trust”
1. love others more
  1. Define “love”
  1. See the lost with compassion
1. seek the Kingdom of God (it was always there) more consistently
1. bear the fruit of the Spirit (others will be able to see it)
1. see sin as a waste of time/energy
1. Show the fruit of the spirit (not some WE produce)
