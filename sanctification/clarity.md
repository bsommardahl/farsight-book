## We begin to see things more clearly

1. The “actual” reality of things, not our immature, world-inspired reality
1. Salvation see as only a beginning
1. Realize we are eternal (always have been)
1. God's version of "Good" is worth blindly trusting 
1. His plan is better, every time
1. Every “bad experience” is actually a good experience
1. Growth is preparation for eternity, “bring it on!"
1. Temporal, earthly ending (death) is a pass to the real life intended for us
